## Accessible design for the office

This is a site to help designers who are new to accessibility, especially those working in InDesign and Powerpoint, to design for people in an office environment.

It's not for the more advanced user who has a question about meeting specific WGAG standards - there's plenty of other resources for that (see the links page).

**This should help answer:**
- How do you design for the end user?
- How does it fit into the design workflow?
- Where can I go for further guidance?
